        <h2>What makes corn dogs a great snack</h2>
        <p>Corn Dogs is a simple yet delicious food. The bread is crispy on the outside and soft in 
        the inside. When you take a bite, you'll be met with a savory and juicy hot dog. The batter 
        and hot dog compliment each other quite well. Any type of meat can be used for hot dogs making 
        corn dogs delicious for all kinds of taste buds. Some prefer Beef, pork, etc. You can go an 
        extra step and customize the exterior with any condiment of your choice. The most popular 
        choices of condiments are ketchup and mustard. In reality you can choose any. It's all up to 
        you and your taste buds. Corn dogs are great if you're in a hurry, but want to eat a quick 
        snack on the go. You won't have to worry about a plate because corn dogs are held from a 
        stick. Although it can get messy depending on how much condiment you added.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For Corn Dogs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 hot dogs, we used turkey hot dogs</li>
            <li>12 sticks</li>
            <li>Peanut oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Ketchup and mustard to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For batter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fine yellow corn meal</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 2-3” of oil in a large pot or dutch oven and heat to 350˚F over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pat dry with paper towels. Insert sticks into hot dogs.</li>
            <li>Whisk together dry ingredients (corn meal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt). 
            Whisk together wet ingredients (buttermilk, egg, 1 Tbsp oil and honey). Combine wet and 
            dry ingredients and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into a drinking glass almost to the top and dip hot dogs. Put corn dog 
            straight down into batter and give it a little twirl to fully coat the hot dogs then 
            swirl as you lift up. Let excess drip off.</li>
            <li>Hold corn dog at an angle in the hot oil for 5-7 seconds to let it seal then drop 
            into oil (this keeps them from sticking to the bottom of the pot).</li>
            <li>Fry 3 minutes or until golden brown. Fry up to 2-3 at a time (so you don't drop 
            the temperature), turning them as needed to brown evenly. Transfer to a wire rack 
            to cool.</li>
        </ol>
