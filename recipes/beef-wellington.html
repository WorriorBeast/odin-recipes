        <h2>Making homemade Beef Wellington</h2>
        <p>Beef Wellington is a dish where everyone has to try it at least once. Beef wellington is a 
        mix between steak and pastry. Sounds as a not very tasty combination, but in fact it's very 
        delicious. Beef wellington consists of a tenderloin in the center covered with mushroom and 
        wrapped in a pastry. Beef Wellington is among the best dishes. Part of its popularity is due 
        to being Gordon Ramsey's signature dish. You have more than likely heard about beef wellington 
        on television in one of Gordon Ramsey's cooking show. Unfortunately beef wellington is not a 
        simple dish to make. Beef wellington is served in very limited amount of restaurant and 
        majority of those restaurants require making a reservation. Fortunately I have made a recipe 
        for those that want to try beef wellington, but cannot go to a restaurant.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>(2 lb.) center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 shallot, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>Leaves from 1 thyme sprig</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>12 thin slices prosciutto all-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
            <li>4 oz. frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>Flaky salt, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt 
            and pepper.</li>
            <li>Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly 
            smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 
            minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, 
            snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme 
            until finely chopped.</li>
            <li>To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and cook 
            until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then let 
            cool in fridge.</li>
            <li>Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it's twice the 
            length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a 
            rectangle that's big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly 
            and thinly over the prosciutto.</li>
            <li>Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into 
            prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto 
            as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge 
            to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and 
            roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the 
            prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on 
            bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then 
            tightly roll beef into pastry.</li>
            <li>Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges 
            with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then 
            chill for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg 
            wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.</li>
            <li>Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 
            to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before carving and serving.</li>
        </ol>
