            <li>4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup Panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags 
            work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat 
            mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle 
            flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb 
            mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest 
            for 10 to 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to 
            shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The 
            chicken will finish cooking in the oven</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. 
            Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and 
            provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 
            teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts 
            are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
            into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
